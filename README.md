## Plugin to launch taskell from nnn and sync kanban boards with git. Pretty simple.
# Requires: 

* [git](https://git-scm.com/) the only serious vcs
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) cli search utility
* [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) highly configurable file manager
* [taskell](https://github.com/smallhadroncollider/taskell) cli kanban boards (unmaintained, dev on hiatus) 

and a repo for your boards.

Add to nnn plugins directory
